# NIK-extractor
A somewhat functioning extractor for Indonesia ID card number. This was created with the goal to shorten the card number extraction using manual entry. Upload your ID card image (make sure to follow the format) and your card number will be printed
Please follow the following steps for the best performance:
- Make sure the image is clear and not blurry
- The ID card image must be in the correct position (not tilted), below is an example
- The NIK text must be readable and have high contrast (good lighting)
- The ID card background color must be a different color from the KTP background
